# Checkers Game with Minimax AI

## Description

This project is a Checkers game where the player can compete against a computer opponent. The computer opponent uses the Minimax algorithm to compute the best possible moves, making it a challenging adversary.

## Features

- Play checkers against a computer opponent.
- Minimax algorithm to determine the optimal moves for the computer.
- Basic checkers game logic and rules.

## Minimax Algorithm

### Overview

The Minimax algorithm is a decision-making algorithm used in game theory and artificial intelligence. It is commonly employed in two-player games like checkers, chess, and tic-tac-toe. The goal of Minimax is to determine the optimal move for a player assuming that the opponent also plays optimally. 

### How Minimax Works

1. **Game Tree Construction**:
   - The algorithm constructs a tree of all possible moves from the current game state. Each node in the tree represents a game state, and edges represent the moves leading to these states.

2. **Recursive Evaluation**:
   - The Minimax algorithm recursively evaluates these game states from the leaf nodes (end states) up to the root node (current game state). 
   - At each level, the algorithm alternates between maximizing and minimizing the scores:
     - **Maximizing Player**: Tries to maximize the score. This is typically the player whose turn it is.
     - **Minimizing Player**: Tries to minimize the score. This is typically the opponent.

3. **Score Assignment**:
   - Leaf nodes are assigned scores based on the game outcome (e.g., win, loss, or draw). These scores are propagated up the tree to determine the best move for the maximizing player.

4. **Optimal Move Selection**:
   - The algorithm selects the move that leads to the optimal score for the maximizing player while assuming the opponent will also play optimally to minimize the score.

### Role in Checkers Game

In this Checkers game project, the Minimax algorithm plays a crucial role in determining the moves of the computer opponent:

- **Optimal Moves**: The computer uses the Minimax algorithm to evaluate all possible moves and select the one that provides the best outcome, assuming the player also makes optimal moves.
- **Game Tree Depth**: To ensure reasonable computation times, the depth of the game tree may be limited. This means the algorithm evaluates a finite number of moves ahead, rather than all possible moves.
- **Heuristic Evaluation**: For deeper levels of the game tree, heuristic evaluation functions may be used to estimate the value of non-terminal nodes to improve performance.

### Advantages

- **Strategic Play**: By evaluating possible moves to a certain depth, the Minimax algorithm helps the computer opponent play strategically and make informed decisions.
- **Challenge**: It provides a challenging experience for players, as the computer opponent strives to play optimally.

### Limitations

- **Computational Complexity**: The algorithm can become computationally expensive as the depth of the game tree increases, especially in complex games with many possible moves.
- **Depth Limitation**: To manage complexity, the algorithm may use depth limits and heuristic evaluations, which can sometimes lead to suboptimal decisions.

The Minimax algorithm enhances the AI of the computer opponent, making it a significant feature of this Checkers game, and provides a robust foundation for future improvements and extensions.
